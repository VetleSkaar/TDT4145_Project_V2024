# TDT4145_Project_V2024
Project for NTNU course TDT4145 Spring 2024 

Run task1.py to reset database and populate with basic information.

I did not manage to finish the tasks as described. I asked for a 24h extension to finish.

The misunderstanding can be seen in index.py where i started to develop a complete system for registering/login and buying tickets for specific performances.

I will deliver a more complete project after the due date. If this secound delivery is not counted, I hope the code I wrote in index.py counts for something. I also hope my knowledge of python and SQL can be seen in the parts that are finished and may act as a redeeming factor despite the missing parts of the project.

All in all I have managed to complete most of task 1 and some of task 4. In addition to the basic setup of the project within the time limit. I have also included all the code I wrote that did not directly answer the tasks in the project description.

/sql folder includes sql scema
/src includes the rest of the code.
/files needed includes txt files to be read into the system.
